# 🏗️ U.S. Building Permit Analysis — March 2025

This project analyzes newly issued residential building permits across U.S. states using March 2025 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Top-performing states by permits: Texas, Florida, and California
- States with lowest activity: Vermont, Alaska, and others
- Each state's share of total permits calculated for context
- Bar charts to visualize both top and bottom 10 states

## 📁 Files Included
- `building_permit_analysis_2025.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full code and charts
- `march_2025_permit_insights.csv` — cleaned and enriched dataset

## 🛢️ SQL Extension

To extend this analysis and simulate real-world workflows, the cleaned dataset was also loaded into a **SQLite database** and queried using SQL.

### 🔹 SQL Insights
- 🏆 Top 10 states by permits (SQL version)
- 📉 Bottom 5 states by permits
- 📊 Share of total U.S. permits by state
- 📐 Total permits issued nationally

### 🔹 SQL Files
- `building_permits.db` — SQLite database (generated via Python)
- `sql/analysis_queries.sql` — full set of SQL queries used
- `sql/building_permit_insights.md` — markdown summary of insights derived via SQL

> This SQL addition demonstrates my ability to work with structured data sources, use analytical queries, and produce business-ready summaries — key skills for data science roles in real estate analytics and beyond.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQLite + SQL
- Jupyter Notebook
- DB Browser for SQLite

## 💡 Use Case
This type of analysis is valuable for commercial real estate data platforms (like LightBox), developers, investors, and market analysts looking to identify growth hotspots.
